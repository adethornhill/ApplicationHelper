# ApplicationHelper

## Description

ApplicationHelper is a Swift Project to help organize and tracking job applications.

## Usage

Run the ApplicationHelperApp.swift in Xcode

On the home page there are buttons to add applications and update applications.

In the top right corner of the home page there is a folder icon.
Clicking on this icon takes you to the appplications page which lists all of the applications added as well as their status.

## Known Bugs

On the applications page, the filter and sort dropdown list do not currently work together.  

If you choose a filter from the filter list and a sort descriptor from the sort list, the applications will be sorted or filtered based on which option was chosen most recently and will not be both filtered and sorted on both options chosen.

At this moment, this project was only tested on the iPhone 12 simulator and therefore the visuals may not render properly on lower screen widths.
